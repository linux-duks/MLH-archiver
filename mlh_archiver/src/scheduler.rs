/// The scheduler is responsible for:
/// - Creating channels for worker communication
/// - Spawning worker threads (one per worker)
/// - Spawning producer threads (one per worker group)
/// - Waiting for all threads to complete
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// For each worker group:
/// 1. Creates a bounded channel (sender/receiver)
/// 2. Spawns workers, each with a clone of the receiver
/// 3. Spawns a producer with the sender
/// 4. Producer sends tasks; workers compete to receive them
///
/// # Thread Lifecycle
///
/// - **Worker threads**: Run until channel closes or shutdown requested
/// - **Producer threads**: Send all tasks, then drop sender to signal completion
/// - **Main thread**: Waits for all threads via `join()`
///
/// # Shutdown
///
/// Workers check the shared shutdown flag (passed at creation time).
/// When Ctrl+C is pressed:
/// 1. Signal handler sets the flag
/// 2. Workers detect flag and exit gracefully
/// 3. Producer threads detect closed channels and exit
